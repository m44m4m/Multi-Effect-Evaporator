# üå°Ô∏è Multi-Effect Evaporator ‚Äì Process Control Project

### üéØ Project Overview
This project models and controls a **three-effect evaporator** using **MATLAB/Simulink**.  
It implements nonlinear **mass and energy balance equations** for each effect, and applies a **PID controller** tuned for the final concentration (**C‚ÇÉ**) to maintain product quality.  
The model includes actuator and sensor dynamics, as well as dead time and realistic process disturbances.
